This function takes in a list and finds the minimum and maximum number of the list. 
The time efficiency is O(n) since each item in the list will be traversed. The implementation allows for a single traversal.
The space efficiency is O(1), given that only pointers were used to keep track of the maximum and minimum numbers.
